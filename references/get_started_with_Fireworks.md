## Installation and Setup

To run these projects locally, follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the Fireworks repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fw-ai/cookbook.git
cd examples
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment ensures that dependencies are isolated from your system Python installation.

1. **Create the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On **MacOS/Linux**:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - On **Windows**:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies for the project:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Each project may have additional dependencies specified in its own directory. After navigating to the respective project folder, install any extra requirements with:

```bash
pip3 install -r <project_folder>/requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Projects

Now that your environment is set up, navigate to the project directory you want to run. For example, for inference:

```bash
cd 1_inference
python inference_example.py
```

Follow the instructions in each project’s `README.md` for specific details and commands.
