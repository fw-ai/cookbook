        "In this example we will use AutoGen framework to construct an agent that is capable of generating an image through DALLE-3 and saving it to local disk.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this demo, we are going to utilize [function calling](https://readme.fireworks.ai/docs/function-calling) feature launched by Fireworks. We initialize two agents - `UserProxyAgent` and `AssistantAgent`. The `AssistantAgent` is given the ability to issue a call for the provided functions but not execute them while `UserProxyAgent` is given the ability to execute the function calls issues by the `AssistantAgent`. In order to achieve this behaviour we use decorators provided by AutoGen library called `register_for_llm` and `register_for_execution`. Using these decorators allows us to easily define python functions and turn them into [JSON Spec](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) needed by function calling API.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we setup system prompt for both the agents. We ask the `AssistantAgent` to be a helpful agent & focus on generating the correct function calls and we leave `UserProxyAgent` as is. For more advanced use cases we can ask `UserProxyAgent` to be a plan generator.\n"
