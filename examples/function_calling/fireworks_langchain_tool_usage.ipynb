        "In this notebook, we demonstrate how we can use Fireworks Function Calling model as a router across multiple models with specialized capabilities. Function calling models have seen rapid rise in usage because of their abilities to use external tools easily. One such powerful tool is other LLMs. We have quite a number of specialized OSS LLMs for [Coding](https://www.deepseek.com/), [Chatting in Certain Language](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen) or just plain [HF Assistants](https://huggingface.co/chat/assistants).\n",
