"""Music scorer: MIDI human-likeness scoring for ABC notation RL.

Stdlib-only on purpose -- MIDI is parsed byte-by-byte in ``core`` rather than
through a library, and the human baseline is a percentile table shipped in
``baselines/``. The one external dependency is the ``abc2midi`` binary, which
renders the model's ABC text so features can be extracted from the MIDI.

The score is 85% conformance to human percentile bands over 18 features in 6
groups, plus 15% Jensen-Shannon agreement with the corpus pitch-class, interval
and duration histograms, clamped to [0, 1].
