The top layer has a golden-brown, caramelized surface, which is characteristic of a caramelized sugar topping.\n   - **Texture**: The bottom part appears smooth and creamy, indicating a custard-like consistency. The top layer has a slightly cracked, glossy texture, which is consistent with a caramelized sugar layer.\n   - **Shape**: The dessert is presented in a cylindrical glass, which is a common serving style for creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The top is flat, and the caramelized layer is evenly distributed, except for the piece that appears to be partially broken or removed.\n\n2. **Cooking Method or Preparation Style**:\n   - The dessert has a custard base, which is typically made by cooking a mixture of cream, eggs, sugar, and vanilla (or other flavorings) until it thickens. This is then chilled and topped with a layer of sugar.\n   - The top layer is caramelized using a torch or broiler, resulting in the characteristic golden-brown, crisp surface.
