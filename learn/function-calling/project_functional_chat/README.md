# Functional Chat Demo App ( :rocket: [Try it!](http://functional-chat.fireworks.ai))

https://github.com/fw-ai/forge/assets/5000576/ce83463e-e898-46a9-9e84-d13d4a12d474

## Quick start

If you need to install Node.js, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/fw-ai/forge/tree/main/apps/functional_chat#configuring-the-environment).

Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Either edit `.env` or create a new file called `.env.local` (recommended) with api keys to the services you want to call.

Run the server in dev mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Capabilities

A simple chat with function calling. Functions can perform tasks that typically involve calling external services. An LLM interprets user messages and decides which function to call and with what parameter values. The model is capable of multi-turn conversations combining the output from multiple functions, refining the calls based on additional instructions and making new calls with parameter values extracted from other function output.

## Included functions

The demo app includes the following functions (new functions are easy to add - see the next section):
- image generation with an SDXL model,
- getting stock quotes curtesy of [alphavantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/),
- charting datasets with chart.js curtesy of [quickchart](https://quickchart.io).

## Adding a new function

To add a new function to the chat follow these steps:
1. Create a file under [functions](https://github.com/fw-ai/forge/tree/main/apps/functional_chat/pages/api/functions) directory. By convention, the file name follows the function name,
2. Implement a `handler` that supports `spec` and `call` query actions. `spec` should return the description of the function parameters in [`json_schema`](https://json-schema.org/) format. `call` performs the function call - often times invoking an external API - and returns the responses in a descriptive format (typically JSON). There are several function spec and call [examples](https://github.com/fw-ai/forge/tree/main/apps/functional_chat/pages/api/functions) that you can copy and modify based on your needs.
3. Include the name of the newly added function in the [`ACTIVE_FUNCTIONS`](https://github.com/fw-ai/forge/blob/main/apps/functional_chat/.env) environment variable.
4. Redeploy your app and have fun!

## Configuring the environment

If you are starting from scratch, here are the steps to follow to set up a Node.js on your host:

1. [Install](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) Node Version Manager (nvm)

2. Install the latest Node.js:
```bash
nvm install stable
```

3. Optional: to make this version your default version, run the following:
```bash
nvm alias default stable
```

4. Optional: To check what version of Node.js that you're running, run the following:
```bash
node -v
```
