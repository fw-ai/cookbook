    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Batch API is designed for asynchronous processing of long-running API tasks by offloading execution and storing results for later retrieval. This architecture is ideal for workloads such as media processing, transcription, translation, and other time-intensive operations that benefit from deferred, non-blocking execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients submit requests synchronously over HTTP, specifying a target endpoint_id and path that define the backend service and API route. The server then processes these requests asynchronously in the background. Clients can check request status at any time and retrieve results once processing is complete. The system is fully endpoint-agnostic, allowing it to seamlessly route and support a wide range of backend services across Fireworks.AI's infrastructure.\n",
