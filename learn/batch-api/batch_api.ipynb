    "# Get Started with Batch API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Batch API is designed for asynchronous processing of long-running API tasks by offloading execution and storing results for later retrieval. This architecture is ideal for workloads such as media processing, transcription, translation, and other time-intensive operations that benefit from deferred, non-blocking execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Design Note:**  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Currently, our Batch API is designed for simplicity by submitting each file as a separate request, with the backend processing them asynchronously. To upload multiple files, we suggest using a loop to submit them individually. We're open to feedback and may consider expanding functionality, including multi-file support, based on user needs and usage patterns.  \n",
    ">  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients submit requests synchronously over HTTP, specifying a target **endpoint_id** and **path** that define the backend service and API route. The server then processes these requests asynchronously in the background. Clients can check request status at any time and retrieve results once processing is complete. The system is fully endpoint-agnostic, allowing it to seamlessly route and support a wide range of backend services across Fireworks.AI's infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on Batch API parameters, including endpoint_id, path, and others, please refer to the link below:\n",
