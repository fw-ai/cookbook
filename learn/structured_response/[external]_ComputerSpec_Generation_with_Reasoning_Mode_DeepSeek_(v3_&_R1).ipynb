        "\n",
        "#### 🔹 **What is Reasoning JSON Mode?**  \n",
        "Reasoning JSON Mode extends structured JSON generation by adding an **explanation of the model’s decision-making process**. This is done by generating a **reasoning section enclosed within `<think>...</think>` tags**, followed by a structured JSON response.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This approach enhances transparency and interpretability by providing insight into **why** the model chose specific components when generating PC specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🔹 **How Does It Work?**  \n",
        "When using Reasoning JSON Mode, the model outputs:  \n",
        "1. A **reasoning block** inside `<think>...</think>`, explaining the thought process.  \n",
        "2. A **valid JSON object** containing structured specifications that adhere to the predefined schema.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures that the **reasoning and structured response remain distinct**, making it easy to extract insights while maintaining machine-readable outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🔹 **Why Use Reasoning JSON Mode for PC Specifications?**  \n",
        "For tasks like generating **gaming PC configurations**, **server builds**, or **custom hardware recommendations**, Reasoning JSON Mode provides:  \n",
        "✅ **Explainability** → Understand why each component was selected.  \n",
        "✅ **Debugging Capability** → Identify model errors by checking its reasoning.  \n",
        "✅ **Structured Data** → JSON output is ready for downstream processing.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For example, instead of simply outputting:\n",
        "```json\n",
        "{ \"processor\": \"AMD Ryzen 9 7950X\", \"gpu\": \"NVIDIA RTX 3090\" }\n",
        "```\n",
        "The model also includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "The user requested a high-performance gaming PC, so I chose the Ryzen 9 7950X for its high core count and strong gaming performance. The RTX 3090 is selected because it balances price and power for 4K gaming.\n",
        "</think>\n",
        "```\n",
        "This helps developers validate the AI's decision-making while maintaining structured responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🔹 **How is Reasoning JSON Mode Different from Standard JSON Mode?**  \n",
        "| Feature  | Standard JSON Mode  | Reasoning JSON Mode |\n",
        "|----------|--------------------|---------------------|\n",
        "| **Structured Output** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n",

        "| **Separation of Reasoning & JSON** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |\n",

The ASUS ROG Strix 3090 requires 3x 8-pin connectors. The Corsair RM1000x has enough cables. Cable extensions for aesthetics?\n",
