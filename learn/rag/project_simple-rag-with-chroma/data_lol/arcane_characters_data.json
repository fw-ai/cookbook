Following a traumatic event (due to an argument of sorts) in which Vander nearly drowns Silco, the two's friendship came to an end. While Vander devoted his life to the safety of the Undercity (a.k.a. the precursor of the nation ofZaun), Silco was fueled by the cause his 'brother' had given up, particularly seeking to use violence in order to get results. Although Silco hated Vander initially, his hate faded over time\u2014and he grew to appreciate that Vander's betrayal made him into the dangerous, ruthless man that he is today.","URL":"https:\/\/leagueoflegends.fandom.com\/wiki\/Silco"},{"Name":"Singed","Background":"Not much is known about Singed's early life. During his younger years, he was known to have worked withHeimerdinger. Although they were initially partners, Heimerdinger did not approve of Singed's unethical and inhumane methods.

He felt a sincere kinship with Viktor due to their similar pasts from being sickly and frail, and helped him try to find a way to cure his illness even though the two of them had not seen each other in years. He was also shown to love and mourn his deceased daughter, and gave Silco a sedative before operating on Jinx so he wouldn't have to watch his adoptive daughter suffer. It's likely that Singed's development into his current sociopathic self was caused by the chemicals he injected into his body to boost his productivity, which came at the cost of his humanity and his empathy.","Abilities":"Singed and Heimerdinger used to be partners and as a result, it can be assumed they were once close. However, as Heimerdinger could not bring himself to accept Singed's depraved methods, the two of them decided to split up and go their own separate ways.
