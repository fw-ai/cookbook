![Building, Deploying, and Fine-Tuning AI Workflows with Fireworks](assets/hero-dark.svg)

# Fireworks AI Cookbook

This repository contains sample applications, Jupyter Notebooks, and resources designed to help you get hands-on with Fireworks AI. You'll explore tools for building, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI, function-calling workflows, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, agentic systems, and more.

This is a living-repo, so please check back as we continuously add new examples, tutorials and reference projects.

# Repository Structure

This repo contains several types of examples organized by their use cases and purpose:

1. **Production-ready examples** in [`./references`](./references): These projects receive regular review and support from the Fireworks engineering team. Each example is production-ready, focusing on specific Fireworks features and abstractions, and shares common dependencies.
2. **Learning-focused examples** in [`./learn`](./learn): These projects are optimized for learning and exploration of AI techniques. Each example is built with experimentation in mind, allowing you to explore patterns for building AI applications. Each project has its own dependencies and Dockerfile for easy setup.
3. **Showcase projects** in [`./showcase`](./showcase): User-contributed examples of Fireworks in action! These are community-driven projects that may not always follow production standards but demonstrate creative ways to use Fireworks.
4. **Integration examples** in [`./integrations`](./integrations): Examples provided by Fireworks partners, illustrating how to integrate with external services or platforms (e.g., MongoDB). Each integration example includes dedicated resources and documentation from the contributing partners.

We appreciate your feedback and contributions! Please see our [contribution guide](./Contribution.md) for more information on how to contribute to this repository.
