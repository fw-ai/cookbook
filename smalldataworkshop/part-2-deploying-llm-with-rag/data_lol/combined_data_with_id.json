However, due to unknown circumstances, Vander eventually betrayed Silco and attempted to drown him in Zaun's polluted rivers. Although Silco managed to survive the incident, the chemicals in the water heavily scarred his face and mutated his left eye.[1]","Appearance":"Silco was a tall and thin middle-aged man with pale, greyish skin, black hair styled into an undercut, a right blue eye, and heavy scarring on the left side of his face. His most notable trait was his left eye, which lacked an eyelid and appeared to be heavily discolored, with an orange iris and black sclera. He was also generally seen wearing a red and black Piltovan three-piece suit.","Personality":"Silco is a ruthless and brutal, yet highly intelligent and cautious man who will do anything to carry out his ambitions. He believes that base violence is the only way to stand against Piltover and unite the underground against the Topsiders, and that power only comes to those who are willing to forsake their own morals to achieve it. His ultimate goal is to free the undercity from Piltover's control and allow it to become an independent Zaunite state under his rule, which he refers to as the Nation of Zaun.","Abilities":"Vander and Silco were once presumably close, as they refer to one another as brothers in the past. Following a traumatic event (due to an argument of sorts) in which Vander nearly drowns Silco, the two's friendship came to an end. While Vander devoted his life to the safety of the Undercity (a.k.a. the precursor of the nation ofZaun), Silco was fueled by the cause his 'brother' had given up, particularly seeking to use violence in order to get results. Although Silco hated Vander initially, his hate faded over time\u2014and he grew to appreciate that Vander's betrayal made him into the dangerous, ruthless man that he is today.","Relations":"Vander and Silco were once presumably close, as they refer to one another as brothers in the past.

As a result, the two of them eventually parted ways, with Singed moving to the undercity.[1]At some point between those events, Singed sired a daughter, who eventually passed away from unknown causes.","Appearance":"Singed is a tall but extremely thin and pale-skinned, middle-aged man with chestnut hair and brown eyes. He is generally shown wearing a tattered brown coat and suit. The fire that destroyed his lab left his hair singed and several scars on his face. Eventually, Singed would start wearing additional bandages on his face to cover up the scars inflicted there by an unknown test subject.","Personality":"Despite his callous demeanor, Singed was not always heartless, as he used to have genuinely good intentions since he wanted his experiments to save lives. He felt a sincere kinship with Viktor due to their similar pasts from being sickly and frail, and helped him try to find a way to cure his illness even though the two of them had not seen each other in years. He was also shown to love and mourn his deceased daughter, and gave Silco a sedative before operating on Jinx so he wouldn't have to watch his adoptive daughter suffer. It's likely that Singed's development into his current sociopathic self was caused by the chemicals he injected into his body to boost his productivity, which came at the cost of his humanity and his empathy.","Abilities":"Singed and Heimerdinger used to be partners and as a result, it can be assumed they were once close. However, as Heimerdinger could not bring himself to accept Singed's depraved methods, the two of them decided to split up and go their own separate ways.

This made it difficult for him to play with the other children, but despite his solitude and physical weakness, the young boy was brilliant and inventive, with a knack for constructing machines on the days he spent alone.","Appearance":"During his time as a non-augmented person, Viktor was a white skinned, amber eyed and brown haired human with a scrawny build. Since his birth he had a deformity preventing him to walk and run naturally, needing a walking stick to move (later a walking crutch). During his time exposed to Zaunite pollution, it would greatly worsen his health conditions.","Personality":"Viktor is an idealistic, altruistic, genuis introvert with a passion for science and its ability to improve lives for the better. Growing up in the slums ofZaunas a poor, sick, crippled boy; Viktor understood the suffering everyday people had to endure by living in Zaun's terrible conditions.
