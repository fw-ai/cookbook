    "### Overview of the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the process of building and testing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using **ChromaDB** as the vector store, **Sentence Transformers** for embedding, and **Fireworks** models for language generation. The notebook takes users through data preparation, embedding generation, and querying, and concludes by showcasing how retrieved information can be used to augment model responses."

    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation and Chunking**:\n",
    "   - The notebook starts by reshaping large text datasets (like League of Legends lore) into a long-format, splitting long pieces of text into manageable chunks for embedding. Each chunk is assigned a unique ID based on its context (name, field, category).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ChromaDB for Vector Storage**:\n",
    "   - **ChromaDB** is used as a vector database to store document embeddings and metadata. After preparing the data, it is chunked, encoded into embeddings using **Sentence Transformers**, and upserted (added) to the ChromaDB collection.\n",
    "   - The vector store allows for fast similarity search: queries can retrieve relevant text chunks and their associated metadata from a large corpus, based on their vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fireworks for Model Completions**:\n",
    "   - The **Fireworks** platform is used for generating language model responses in the RAG system. Once relevant chunks of text are retrieved from ChromaDB based on a query, they are passed as context to the Fireworks models.\n",
    "   - The notebook iterates through different **Fireworks** models (such as LLaMA, Mistral, and others) to generate responses based on user queries and retrieved data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:\n",
    "   - The system retrieves relevant documents from ChromaDB using embeddings and metadata. This context is then used to augment the responses generated by the Fireworks models.\n",
    "   - By combining retrieval (from ChromaDB) and generation (from Fireworks), the system can answer questions more effectively by referencing a specific, relevant knowledge base."

    "### How Fireworks Fits into the RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Retrieval-Augmented Generation system:\n",
    "- **ChromaDB** is responsible for storing and retrieving contextually relevant information.\n",
    "- **Fireworks** models generate human-like text responses based on the retrieved information, providing answers that are enriched by the context found in the data.\n",
    "- Fireworks enhances the RAG system by allowing users to choose from different models, compare outputs, and tailor the generated responses to the retrieved data, offering both flexibility and power in AI-driven responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how the combination of ChromaDB for retrieval and Fireworks models for generation can be used to build intelligent systems that provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries.\n"

    "## Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**:\n",
    "   - Load environment variables, including the Fireworks API key, to authenticate API access.\n",
    "   - Set up dependencies and initialize key components such as the Fireworks client and the embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation and Reshaping**:\n",
    "   - Load the dataset (e.g., League of Legends lore) from JSON files.\n",
    "   - Reshape the data from a wide format to a long format, where each row corresponds to a specific character, field (like Background or Abilities), and chunk of text. Long fields are split into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Embedding Generation**:\n",
    "   - Use **Sentence Transformers** to convert each chunk of text into a vector (embedding). These embeddings will allow us to perform similarity searches later.\n",
    "   - Chunked data is processed in batches, and embeddings are generated for each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Upserting Data into ChromaDB**:\n",
    "   - Each data chunk, along with its associated metadata (like category, URL), is upserted into **ChromaDB**, which stores these embeddings and metadata for fast similarity searches.\n",
    "   - Unique IDs are generated for each chunk, ensuring that each entry in the vector database is distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Querying the Vector Store**:\n",
    "   - A query (e.g., \"Tell me about the history of Piltover\") is transformed into an embedding and used to search for the most relevant text chunks stored in ChromaDB.\n",
    "   - The top N results (text chunks and their metadata) are retrieved based on similarity to the query embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generating Model Responses with Fireworks**:\n",
    "   - The retrieved text chunks from ChromaDB serve as context for the language models. This context is used to augment the model’s responses.\n",
    "   - Multiple **Fireworks** models (such as LLaMA and Mistral) are iterated over, each generating responses based on the retrieved context and the user’s query.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Comparison of Model Outputs**:\n",
    "   - The notebook allows you to compare outputs from different models, making it easy to assess which model performs best for a given task or query.\n",
    "   - Outputs are displayed in a structured way for side-by-side comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Final Query Results**:\n",
    "   - The generated responses and their associated metadata are printed, showing how the system retrieves and generates relevant information based on user queries."

    "   \n",
    "2. **`top_p`**: Implements nucleus sampling. This parameter specifies that only tokens with top cumulative probability `p` are considered for output, providing an alternative method to `temperature` for controlling randomness. A value of 1 includes all tokens, while lower values restrict options.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`stop`**: A list of sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. This is useful to end the output at specific words or phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`presence_penalty`**: A positive value increases the likelihood of introducing new topics or words that haven’t appeared in the text before. This encourages creativity and novelty in responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`frequency_penalty`**: Reduces the model’s tendency to repeat the same words or phrases. Positive values make repeated words less likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`n`**: Specifies the number of completions to generate for the prompt. Setting this to a value greater than 1 will return multiple completion options.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`logprobs`**: When set, returns the log probabilities of each token, allowing for more detailed analysis of the model's token selection process.\n",

The plan involved using thousand of chemtech bombs to crack open an area of the land so that a cavern could be created, but the results were catastrophic. In what seemed to be an accident, the bombs triggered a series of earthquakes that completely destroyed the isthmus and sank large districts of Zaun and thousands of its citizens, while also leaking poisonous gas into the city's surviving areas.\", \"Zaunis a polluted undercity located beneath Piltover - once united, they are now separate, symbiotic cultures. Stifled inventors often find their unorthodox research welcomed in Zaun, but reckless industry has rendered whole swathes of the city highly toxic. It is a place both supported and ruined by unchecked industry, mercantilism, and magic run amok. The pollution from the countless factories and laboratories is constantly spewed into the environment. The urban heart of the city is often choked with smog that blocks the morning sun and drains the sky of its pastels. Visitors have called the sky the 'Zaun Gray', and describe staring up at it akin to seeing the beginnings of a cosmic disturbance. As polluted as Zaun is above-ground, its subterranean levels are far worse. All of Zaun's runoff waste pools together in its sewers, mixing together into toxic and mysterious concoctions. Even so, thanks to a thriving black market, chemtech, and mechanical augmentation, the people of Zaun still find ways to prosper.[1]\", \"More than three thousand years ago, a port was founded in the isthmus in the would-be present location of Zaun.

He believes that base violence is the only way to stand against Piltover and unite the underground against the Topsiders, and that power only comes to those who are willing to forsake their own morals to achieve it.

      "1. Piltover, the city-state on an isthmus between Valoran and Shurima, has a rich history of progress and innovation. Originally a port city, it has grown to become a hub for skilled craftspeople and inventors from all over Runeterra, thanks in part to the influence of Heimerdinger, who was inspired to become a genius inventor after seeing a scientist during his time there. The city is governed by a ruling council, which at one point included members such as Salo, Bolbok, and Heimerdinger, who is considered one of the founders of the city and the prestigious Piltover University.\n",
      "2. The history of Piltover is deeply intertwined with the story of Heimerdinger, who arrived at the city as an inventor and made significant contributions to its construction. Heimerdinger was also friends with Stanwick Pididly, a teacher and inventor whose students would go on to make great contributions to the city. After the first Progress Day, Heimerdinger continued to improve the lives of the people of Piltover, earning him a place as one of the city's founders and a statue at the entrance of the Piltover University.\n",
      "3. In addition to its progress and innovation, Piltover also has a history of political maneuvering and council rule. Individuals such as Salo and Bolbok have held seats on the ruling council, helping to guide the city's growth and development. Heimerdinger, one of the city's founders, is also a notable figure in Piltover's political history.\n",

Notable figures such as Sevika and Silco have risen to prominence in Zaun, advocating for violent uprisings and the establishment of an independent Zaunite state under Silco's rule. This tension has been further fueled by incidents such as the destruction of Jayce Talis's workshop and the subsequent investigation by Piltover's wardens.\n",

The city's rise to prominence can be traced back to the contributions of figures like Heimerdinger, who not only inspired the city's technological advancements but also played a crucial role in its governance and education. The establishment of the Piltover University, among other institutions, reflects the city's commitment to progress and knowledge, setting it apart as a beacon of enlightenment in Runeterra.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The relationship between Piltover and Zaun is complex and fraught with tension. While Piltover thrives on the surface, Zaun suffers beneath it, leading to a long-standing conflict that has shaped both cities' identities. Figures like Silco and Sevika from Zaun have emerged as symbols of resistance against Piltover's perceived oppression, advocating for independence and equality. Their actions and ideologies highlight the deep-seated issues between the two cities and the ongoing struggle for power and recognition.\n",

Members like Salo and Bolbok, each with their own agendas and fears, navigate the complexities of maintaining Piltover's status as a leading city-state. Their decisions and policies not only affect Piltover's prosperity but also its relationship with neighboring regions, including the contentious ties with Zaun.\n",

      "4. The character of Stanwick Pididly serves as a poignant example of selfless dedication to Piltover's future. Despite his personal failures as an inventor, his focus on education and the potential of his students ensured his legacy as a key figure in the city's development. Pididly's memorialization underscores the value placed on education and innovation in Piltover, highlighting the city's enduring commitment to progress and improvement.\n",
